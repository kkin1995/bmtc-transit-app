# Sprint 0: US-001 Execution Plan (Local + GitHub)
## Budget-Friendly CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

### User Story
**US-001**: As a developer, I want a complete CI/CD pipeline so that I can deploy code safely and efficiently

**Story Points**: 8  
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Priority**: Critical (blocks all other development)  
**Cost**: **FREE** (using GitHub free tier + local development)

---

## Revised Architecture: Local + GitHub Approach

### Development Strategy
```
Local Development → GitHub Actions CI → GitHub Container Registry → Local/Demo Deployment
├── Docker Compose for local services
├── GitHub Actions for CI/CD (free tier: 2000 minutes/month)
├── GitHub Container Registry for Docker images
├── Local Kubernetes (minikube) or Docker Compose for testing
└── Migration path to AWS when funding available
```

### Cost Breakdown
- **GitHub Actions**: FREE (2000 minutes/month)
- **GitHub Container Registry**: FREE (500MB storage)
- **Local Development**: FREE (your machine resources)
- **Domain**: $10-15/year (optional, can use GitHub Pages subdomain)
- **Total Monthly Cost**: **$0**

## Detailed Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Local Development Foundation (I can do this)

**Duration**: 2-3 hours

#### Step 1.1: Repository Structure & Package Configuration
- [ ] Create monorepo structure with proper workspace setup
- [ ] Set up package.json with workspace configuration
- [ ] Create Docker Compose configuration for all services
- [ ] Set up environment variable templates
- [ ] Create local development scripts

#### Step 1.2: Docker Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Create Dockerfiles for each service
- [ ] Set up Docker Compose with:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Redis cache
  - Mock Kafka (using Redpanda for local dev)
  - InfluxDB for time-series data
  - Local API gateway (Nginx)
- [ ] Create development vs production Docker configs
- [ ] Set up volume mounts for development

#### Step 1.3: Local Development Scripts
- [ ] Create `npm run dev` for full stack development
- [ ] Create `npm run services:up` for starting all services
- [ ] Create `npm run test:integration` for local testing
- [ ] Create database migration and seeding scripts

**Output**: Complete local development environment that mirrors production

---

### Phase 2: GitHub Actions CI Pipeline (I can do this)

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

#### Step 2.1: Continuous Integration Workflow
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` optimized for free tier
- [ ] Set up parallel job execution to maximize efficiency
- [ ] Configure caching for node_modules and Docker layers
- [ ] Set up test execution with coverage reporting

#### Step 2.2: Code Quality Pipeline
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier checks
- [ ] Configure TypeScript type checking
- [ ] Set up security scanning with CodeQL (free on GitHub)
- [ ] Configure dependency vulnerability scanning

#### Step 2.3: Container Building Pipeline
- [ ] Set up Docker build with multi-stage optimization
- [ ] Configure GitHub Container Registry publishing
- [ ] Set up image tagging strategy
- [ ] Optimize for GitHub Actions minute usage

**Output**: Fully automated CI pipeline using GitHub's free tier

---

### Phase 3: Local Testing & Deployment (I can create, YOU test)

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

#### Step 3.1: Local Deployment Setup
- [ ] Create local Kubernetes setup with minikube (optional)
- [ ] Alternative: Enhanced Docker Compose for production-like deployment
- [ ] Set up local SSL certificates for HTTPS testing
- [ ] Create local load balancer configuration

#### Step 3.2: Testing Framework
- [ ] Set up integration testing with Docker Compose
- [ ] Create API testing suite
- [ ] Set up end-to-end testing framework
- [ ] Configure performance testing for local environment

**YOU NEED TO TEST:**
1. Run `npm run dev` and verify all services start
2. Test the application locally
3. Validate CI pipeline with a test commit

**STOP HERE - Wait for your confirmation that local environment works**

---

### Phase 4: Deployment Automation (I can create)

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

#### Step 4.1: GitHub Pages Deployment (Free Static Hosting)
- [ ] Set up GitHub Pages for documentation and landing page
- [ ] Configure custom domain (if you have one)
- [ ] Set up automatic deployment from main branch

#### Step 4.2: Demo Environment Setup
- [ ] Create demonstration deployment using Docker Compose
- [ ] Set up port forwarding for external access (ngrok integration)
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for demo environment
- [ ] Set up basic monitoring and logging

#### Step 4.3: Production-Ready Configuration
- [ ] Create production Docker Compose configurations
- [ ] Set up environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Create backup and restore scripts
- [ ] Document scaling and migration procedures

**Output**: Complete deployment automation ready for any environment

## Free Tier Optimization Strategies

### GitHub Actions Optimization
```yaml
# Strategies to maximize free 2000 minutes/month:
- Parallel job execution
- Aggressive caching (node_modules, Docker layers)
- Conditional workflows (only run on relevant changes)
- Matrix builds only when necessary
- Efficient Docker layer caching
```

### Resource Efficiency
- **Docker Compose**: Optimized service startup order
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with minimal configuration
- **Caching**: Redis with memory limits
- **Message Queue**: Redpanda (lighter than Kafka)
- **Monitoring**: Lightweight logging and metrics

### Development Workflow
- **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests run in <2 minutes
- **Quick Builds**: Docker builds optimized with caching
- **Hot Reload**: Development environment with live reload
- **Easy Reset**: One-command environment reset

---

## Migration Path to Cloud (Future)

### When You Get Funding:
```
Current Setup → AWS Migration
├── Docker Compose → EKS/ECS
├── Local PostgreSQL → RDS
├── Local Redis → ElastiCache
├── Redpanda → MSK (Managed Kafka)
├── GitHub Actions → + AWS CodePipeline
└── Local deployment → Production infrastructure
```

### Migration Benefits:
- **Zero Code Changes**: Same Docker containers
- **Configuration-Only**: Change environment variables
- **Gradual Migration**: Move services one by one
- **Cost Control**: Scale up gradually
