- [ ] Set up image tagging strategy
- [ ] Optimize for GitHub Actions minute usage

**Output**: Fully automated CI pipeline using GitHub's free tier

---

### Phase 3: Local Testing & Deployment (I can create, YOU test)

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

#### Step 3.1: Local Deployment Setup

- [ ] Create local Kubernetes setup with minikube (optional)
- [ ] Alternative: Enhanced Docker Compose for production-like deployment

- [ ] Configure performance testing for local environment

**YOU NEED TO TEST:**

1. Run `npm run dev` and verify all services start
2. Test the application locally
3. Validate CI pipeline with a test commit

**STOP HERE - Wait for your confirmation that local environment works**

---

### Phase 4: Deployment Automation (I can create)

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

#### Step 4.1: GitHub Pages Deployment (Free Static Hosting)

- [ ] Set up GitHub Pages for documentation and landing page
- [ ] Configure custom domain (if you have one)
- [ ] Set up automatic deployment from main branch

#### Step 4.2: Demo Environment Setup

- [ ] Create demonstration deployment using Docker Compose
- [ ] Set up port forwarding for external access (ngrok integration)
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for demo environment
- [ ] Set up basic monitoring and logging

#### Step 4.3: Production-Ready Configuration

- [ ] Create production Docker Compose configurations
- [ ] Set up environment-specific configurations
- [ ] Create backup and restore scripts
- [ ] Document scaling and migration procedures

**Output**: Complete deployment automation ready for any environment

## Free Tier Optimization Strategies

### GitHub Actions Optimization

```yaml
# Strategies to maximize free 2000 minutes/month:
- Parallel job execution
- Aggressive caching (node_modules, Docker layers)
- Conditional workflows (only run on relevant changes)
- Matrix builds only when necessary
- Efficient Docker layer caching
```

### Resource Efficiency

- **Docker Compose**: Optimized service startup order
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with minimal configuration
- **Caching**: Redis with memory limits
- **Message Queue**: Redpanda (lighter than Kafka)
- **Monitoring**: Lightweight logging and metrics

### Development Workflow

- **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests run in <2 minutes
- **Quick Builds**: Docker builds optimized with caching
- **Hot Reload**: Development environment with live reload
- **Easy Reset**: One-command environment reset

---

## Migration Path to Cloud (Future)

### When You Get Funding:

```
Current Setup → AWS Migration
├── Docker Compose → EKS/ECS
├── Local PostgreSQL → RDS
├── Local Redis → ElastiCache
├── Redpanda → MSK (Managed Kafka)
├── GitHub Actions → + AWS CodePipeline
└── Local deployment → Production infrastructure
```

### Migration Benefits:

- **Zero Code Changes**: Same Docker containers
- **Configuration-Only**: Change environment variables
