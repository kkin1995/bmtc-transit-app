# Sprint 0: US-001 Execution Plan
## CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

### User Story
**US-001**: As a developer, I want a complete CI/CD pipeline so that I can deploy code safely and efficiently

**Story Points**: 8  
**Estimated Duration**: 4-6 days  
**Priority**: Critical (blocks all other development)

---

## Prerequisites & Setup Requirements

### What YOU Need to Provide/Complete:
1. **GitHub Repository Access**
   - Ensure you have admin access to the GitHub repository
   - GitHub Pro/Team account (for advanced Actions features)

2. **AWS Account Setup**
   - AWS account with billing configured
   - Root access or admin IAM user credentials
   - Estimated cost: $50-100/month for development infrastructure

3. **Domain & SSL** (Optional for Sprint 0, can be done later)
   - Domain name for the application (e.g., bmtc-app.com)
   - Can proceed without this initially

### What I Can Help Create:
- All configuration files and workflows
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Kubernetes manifests)
- Documentation and setup guides
- Troubleshooting support

## Detailed Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Repository Structure & Initial Workflows (I can do this)

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

#### Step 1.1: Create Repository Structure
- [ ] Create proper directory structure for monorepo
- [ ] Set up package.json for the project
- [ ] Create initial README and documentation
- [ ] Set up .gitignore and .gitattributes

#### Step 1.2: Create Basic GitHub Actions Workflows
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for continuous integration
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/cd-staging.yml` for staging deployment
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/cd-production.yml` for production deployment
- [ ] Create reusable workflow templates

**Output**: Repository structure with basic CI/CD workflows ready for testing

---

### Phase 2: AWS Infrastructure Setup (YOU need to do this)

**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Your Action Required**: AWS account setup and credential configuration

#### Step 2.1: AWS Account Preparation
**YOU NEED TO DO:**
1. Log into your AWS account
2. Create an IAM user for GitHub Actions with programmatic access
3. Create IAM policies and roles for EKS, ECR, and other services
4. Generate AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
5. Add these as GitHub Secrets in your repository

**Specific AWS Permissions Needed:**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "eks:*",
                "ec2:*",
                "ecr:*",
                "iam:*",
                "cloudformation:*",
                "s3:*",
                "logs:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**GitHub Secrets to Add:**
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_REGION` (recommend: ap-south-1 for Bengaluru)

#### Step 2.2: Initial AWS Setup Commands
**YOU NEED TO RUN** (I'll provide the exact commands):
```bash
# Install AWS CLI
# Configure AWS credentials
# Create S3 bucket for Terraform state
# Create ECR repositories for Docker images
```

**STOP HERE - Wait for my confirmation when you've completed Phase 2**

---

### Phase 3: Infrastructure as Code (I can create this)

**Duration**: 2-3 hours

#### Step 3.1: Create Terraform Infrastructure
- [ ] Create Terraform modules for EKS cluster
- [ ] Create VPC and networking configuration
- [ ] Create RDS instances for databases
- [ ] Create ElastiCache for Redis
- [ ] Create MSK for Kafka
- [ ] Create IAM roles and policies

#### Step 3.2: Create Kubernetes Manifests
- [ ] Create namespace configurations
- [ ] Create deployment templates
- [ ] Create service and ingress configurations
- [ ] Create ConfigMaps and Secrets templates

**Output**: Complete infrastructure definition ready for deployment

---

### Phase 4: Terraform Deployment (YOU need to run this)

**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Your Action Required**: Execute Terraform deployment

**YOU NEED TO RUN** (I'll provide exact commands):
```bash
# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Plan the deployment
terraform plan

# Apply the infrastructure
terraform apply
```

**Expected Outcomes:**
- EKS cluster running
- Database instances created
- All networking configured
- ECR repositories available

**STOP HERE - Wait for my confirmation when infrastructure is deployed**

---

### Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration (I can do this)

**Duration**: 2-3 hours

#### Step 5.1: Configure Build Pipeline
- [ ] Set up Docker build stages
- [ ] Configure multi-stage builds for optimization
- [ ] Set up image tagging strategy
- [ ] Configure build caching

#### Step 5.2: Configure Testing Pipeline
- [ ] Set up unit test execution
- [ ] Configure integration test environment
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting
- [ ] Configure security scanning (SAST/DAST)

#### Step 5.3: Configure Deployment Pipeline
- [ ] Set up staging deployment automation
- [ ] Configure blue-green deployment strategy
- [ ] Set up rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Configure environment promotion gates

**Output**: Fully automated CI/CD pipeline with testing and security gates

---

### Phase 6: Pipeline Testing & Validation (Collaborative)

**Duration**: 1-2 hours

#### Step 6.1: Test CI Pipeline
**I WILL CREATE**: Test code and documentation  
**YOU WILL**: Execute test deployments and validate results

- [ ] Test pull request workflows
- [ ] Validate code quality gates
- [ ] Test security scanning
- [ ] Verify test execution

#### Step 6.2: Test CD Pipeline
- [ ] Test staging deployment
- [ ] Validate application accessibility
- [ ] Test rollback functionality
- [ ] Verify monitoring and logging

**Output**: Validated, working CI/CD pipeline

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items:
1. **AWS Cost Overrun**
   - **Mitigation**: Set up billing alerts, use spot instances for non-critical workloads
   - **Monitor**: Daily cost tracking in first week

2. **EKS Complexity**
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple configuration, iterate and improve
   - **Fallback**: Use AWS ECS if EKS proves too complex

3. **Pipeline Failures**
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing in isolated environment first
   - **Recovery**: Manual deployment procedures documented

### Medium Risk Items:
1. **GitHub Actions Limitations**
   - **Mitigation**: Understand free tier limits, upgrade if needed
2. **Infrastructure Deployment Time**
   - **Mitigation**: Plan for 30-45 minute deployment times

---

## Success Metrics

### Pipeline Performance:
- **Build Time**: Target <10 minutes for full CI pipeline
- **Deployment Time**: Target <15 minutes for staging deployment
- **Success Rate**: Target >95% pipeline success rate
- **Test Coverage**: Target >80% code coverage

### Infrastructure Reliability:
- **Provisioning Success**: 100% successful infrastructure deployment
- **Environment Consistency**: Staging matches production configuration
- **Security Compliance**: All security scans pass

## Next Steps After Completion

Once US-001 is complete, we'll immediately move to:
1. **US-002**: Containerized services setup
2. **US-003**: Monitoring and logging infrastructure
3. Begin parallel development of core application components

---

## Ready to Begin?

**Please confirm:**
1. ✅ You have AWS account access and are ready to incur infrastructure costs
2. ✅ You have GitHub admin access to set up secrets and workflows
3. ✅ You're ready to follow the step-by-step execution plan
4. ✅ You understand your responsibilities vs. what I'll create for you

**Estimated Total Cost for Sprint 0**: $200-300/month for complete infrastructure

**Time Commitment from You**: 4-6 hours spread over 2-3 days for AWS setup and testing

Would you like me to proceed with **Phase 1** and create the initial repository structure and GitHub Actions workflows?
