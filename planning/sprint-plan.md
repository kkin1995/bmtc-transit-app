## Risk Management & Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Items

1. **Real-time Performance**: Critical for user adoption
   - **Mitigation**: Continuous performance testing, caching optimization
2. **Data Quality**: Essential for trust and reliability
   - **Mitigation**: ML validation, user feedback loops
3. **User Adoption**: Success depends on critical mass
   - **Mitigation**: Gamification, social features, marketing
4. **Privacy Compliance**: Regulatory requirement
   - **Mitigation**: Privacy-by-design, continuous compliance monitoring

### Technical Debt Management

- Allocate 20% of each sprint to technical debt
- Regular architecture reviews
- Code quality gates in CI/CD
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Quality Assurance Strategy

- Automated testing at all levels (unit, integration, e2e)
- Manual testing for UX and edge cases
- Security testing throughout development
- Performance testing before each release
