# BMTC Transit App - System Design Todo List

## Project Overview

This is the system design phase for the BMTC (Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport
Corporation) Transit App - a **crowdsourced real-time transit tracking system**
that relies entirely on user-contributed location data. The app focuses
exclusively on Bengaluru metropolitan area and does not use official transit
APIs.

### Key Project Characteristics:

- **Crowdsourcing-First**: All real-time data comes from users sharing location
  while riding transit
- **Privacy-by-Design**: Anonymous data handling with 24-hour retention policy
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-15 second latency for location updates
- **Scalability Target**: 10,000+ concurrent users, 100+ contributors per route
- **Mobile-First**: React Native for Android 8.0+ and iOS 14.0+

## Next Steps Recommendation

**Immediate Priority** (Suggested next 3 tasks):

1. **Component Interactions** - Critical for development team understanding
2. **Cold Start Strategy** - Essential for initial launch success
3. **Monitoring & Observability** - Important for production readiness

**Development Readiness**: The system design is now 75% complete and ready for
development team handoff. The remaining 5 tasks focus on implementation details
and operational concerns.

## Key Design Decisions Made

1. **React Native** chosen for cross-platform mobile development
2. **Node.js + TypeScript** for backend services
3. **Multi-database approach**: PostgreSQL (transactional), InfluxDB
   (time-series), PostGIS (spatial), Redis (cache)
4. **Apache Kafka** for real-time data streaming
5. **Privacy-first architecture** with immediate anonymization
6. **Microservices architecture** for scalability
7. **WebSocket** for real-time client communication
8. **Machine Learning** for data validation and quality assurance

## Context for Future Claude Instances

This project is in the **system design phase** following completion of
functional requirements. The goal is to create comprehensive technical
documentation that can guide the development team in building a production-ready
crowdsourced transit app.

**Important Notes**:

- All designs prioritize user privacy and data anonymization
- System must work without official BMTC/Metro APIs (crowdsourced only)
- Real-time performance is critical (sub-15 second latency)
- Bengaluru-specific implementation with English/Kannada support
- Battery optimization essential for mobile location tracking

**Usage Instructions**:

1. Use `TodoRead` tool to get current status
2. Use `TodoWrite` tool to update progress
3. Mark tasks as "in_progress" when starting, "completed" when finished
4. Follow existing naming convention for design documents
5. Reference functional requirements in `specs/functional-requirements-v1.md`
